# visual-sorting

@author: P. Kaiser

This project is a visualization of different sorting algorithms.
In the upper left there are buttons to choose which algorithms one wants to compare.
In the upper mid there is a slider to choose how many elements the unsorted arrays should contain. 
This slider also changes the speed of the visualization, more elements lead to faster speed.
Up to 20 elements are visualized very slow to gain a deeper understanding on how the algorithm works.
The start button starts both selected algorithms and after they finished sorting, the visualization will start.
