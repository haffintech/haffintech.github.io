# visual-sorting

@author: P. Kaiser

This project is a visualization of different sorting algorithms.
In the upper left there are buttons to choose which algorithms one wants to compare.
In the upper mid there is a slider to choose how many elements the unsorted arrays should contain.
This slider also changes the speed of the visualization, more elements lead to faster speed.
After successfully sorting the arrays, one can reset them by moving the slider again which allows another sorting comparison.
Up to 20 elements are visualized very slow to gain a deeper understanding on how the algorithm works.
The sort button starts the selected algorithm(s) and after they finished sorting, the visualization will start.
